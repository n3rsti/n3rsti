### Hi there, I'm **n3rsti** - Krzysztof Witucki. 

## Coding experience
I've been coding for the last 2-3 years mainly in web technologies. I started with frontend so I have a basic knowledge about html, css, js. Basic means that I can easily create a full-responsive website using best practices which is also accessible. For the last year I've been focusing more on backend technologies. Main technologies I'm using are Python and Django, but creating web applications also taught me fundamentals of WebSockets and MySQL.

All languages / technologies I'm using:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Python
- Django
- WebSockets (using django-channels)
- MySQL
- Linux (Ubuntu dekstop and basics of Ubuntu server)
- Basics of Selenium (testing django views)

I also have a basic knowledge about Apache2, Daphne, Redis - I can setup basic environment for web application, but I can't fully understand them **yet**.

I'd also like to learn more about embedded systems:
- C
- Microcontrollers

## Projects
I'm currently working on [ToDoChat](https://github.com/n3rsti/ToDoChat). I started this project about a year ago, but I've had a break from working on it so I've been working on it for a few months. In ToDoChat you can:
- Create user
- Create servers, server channels
- Add users to friends / servers
- Chat with friend in private channel
- Chat with friends in server text-channel
- Create tasks (assign users, create deadline)
- Change task status
- Add task comments

I'm currently working on notifications for:
- [x] private messages
- [x] server messages
- [ ] adding user to server
- [ ] adding user to friends list
